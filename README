ChunkLoad

A Bukkit plugin to prevent selected chunks from unloading
Inspired by ForeverALoad by Piedo_bear which is discontinued as of Minecraft 1.2

Requires WorldEdit

Usage:
/chunkload add <name> - adds the chunks of the current selection as region <name> and prevents them from unloading
/chunkload remove <name> - deletes the region, so it may be unloaded again
/chunkload list [page] - lists the currently defined regions
/chunkload select <name> - sets your WorldEdit selection to the chunks of region <name>

/chunkload configure <name> - shows the region and its configuration
/chunkload configure <name> <option> - shows the value of <option>
/chunkload configure <name> <option> true|false|default - turns an option on or off for region <name>
/chunkload configure <name> -<option> - (minus sign in front of the option) sets <option> to its default value (same as /chunkload configure <name> <option> default)

/chunkload options - lists all available options:
	- inactive: chunks of inactive regions may be unloaded; this can be used to temporarily disable a region
	- load-on-start: load the chunks of this region into memory at server startup

/chunkload reload - rereads the configuration file - TODO: this doesn't work

/cl is an alias to /chunkload
all subcommands except reload can be abbreviated to their first letter

To use ChunkLoad you need either the chunkload.usage permission or (if enabled in the configuration) be an operator on the server 

Configuration:
allow-ops - allow operators to use ChunkLoad even if they don't have the required permissions; default: true
worlds.<worldname>.<regionname> - rectangles of chunks to keep loaded, manual editing at your own risk

Todo:
- have a look at the ForeverALoad features and implement them
