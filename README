ChunkLoad

A Bukkit plugin to prevent selected chunks from unloading
Inspired by ForeverALoad by Piedo_bear which is discontinued as of Minecraft 1.2

Requires WorldEdit

Usage:
/chunkload add <name> - adds the chunks of the current selection as region <name> and prevents them from unloading
/chunkload remove <name> - deletes the region, so it may be unloaded again
/chunkload list [page] - lists the currently defined regions
/chunkload select <name> - Sets your WorldEdit selection to the chunks of region <name>
/chunkload reload - rereads the configuration file

/cl is an alias to /chunkload
all subcommands except reload can be abbreviated to their first letter

To use ChunkLoad you need either the chunkload.usage permission or (if enabled in the configuration) be an operator on the server 

Configuration:
allow-ops - allow operators to use ChunkLoad even if they don't have the required permissions; default: true
worlds.<worldname>.<regionname> - rectangles of chunks to keep loaded, manual editing at your own risk
